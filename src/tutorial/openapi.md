# OpenAPI Descriptions

The [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) aims to provide HTTP API developers with a conventional way to describe RESTful APIs in a language-agnostic method that allows both humans and computers to discover, understand, and integrate multiple APIs without access to the implementation of those APIs. 

Written in either JSON or YAML syntax, OpenAPI descriptions can either be written manually, or generated from the API source code. In the case of minimal APIs with .NET, OpenAPI descriptions are generated using an open-source package known as [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/). 

## Enabling OpenAPI

As shown in the [first steps](/tutorial/first-steps.html#interactive-api-docs) tutorial, one fantastic use-case for enabling a minimal API project with OpenAPI output is for documentation and testing purposes. The Swagger UI test and documentation page give developers a quick-and-easy way to debug their APIs quickly. 

We'll explore two ways you can enable OpenAPI descriptions from your minimal APIs - either when you create your API project, or by adding OpenAPI output to an existing API project.

### Create a minimal API with OpenAPI

### Add OpenAPI to a minimal API
